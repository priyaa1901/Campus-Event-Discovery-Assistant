The Campus Event Discovery Assistant is a multi-agent system that centralizes campus event information by automatically collecting, categorizing, and presenting events from various sources like Instagram. It consists of an Event Ingestor Agent that scrapes official Instagram pages for event details, an Event Cleaner & Deduplicator Agent that removes duplicate events, a Category & Keyword Classifier Agent that tags events by category (Technical, Cultural, Sports, Career, Other), and a Query & Notification Agent that allows students to query events via a command-line interface and receive reminders via email or chatbot. Using Instagram pages and SQLite for data storage, the system requires minimal effort from organizers or admins while providing students with a personalized, up-to-date feed of campus events, enhancing engagement and simplifying event discovery.
